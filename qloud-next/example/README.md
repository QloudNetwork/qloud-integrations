# Qloud Next.js Example Application

This is an example application demonstrating how to use [@qloud/next](../) to use [Qloud](https://qloud.network) as an
authentication provider for a Next.js application.

## Start the Application

Install dependencies:

```shell
npm install
```

Start the Next.js application:

```shell
npm run dev
```

Open http://loqal.host:3000 in your browser. You will be redirected to https://login.loqal.host where you can
authenticate with an arbitrary e-mail address. Make sure to change the forward port to `3000`.
